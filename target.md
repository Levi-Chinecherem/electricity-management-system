The overall expected result from the described system is to create a web-based expert electricity metering and billing system with the following key functionalities:

1. **User Authentication and Account Management:**

   - Users can create accounts and log in.
   - Differentiate between consumer types (household, industrial, business establishment).
   - Administrators have special privileges for power control commands, viewing customer details, and managing connections.
2. **Premises Installation:**

   - Users can install their premises and specify whether it is a household, industrial, or business establishment.
   - Different billing conditions for household (prepayment) and business/industrial (postpaid).
3. **Metering:**

   - Record and display the consumed units by a consumer.
   - Ability to request and send demand through SMS.
   - Use of a simulated smart meter for communication with the website.
4. **Load Appliance Control:**

   - Control load appliances from both ends using a relay circuit.
   - Administrators can issue power control commands.
5. **Billing:**

   - Supports both prepaid and postpaid modes.
   - In the prepaid mode, users can recharge their balance.
   - In the postpaid mode, monthly bills are sent to users.
6. **Report Generation and SMS Communication:**

   - Generate a daily report and send it to the service provider through SMS.
   - Simulated smart meter can send and receive information from the website through a web communication foundation.
7. **Record Keeping:**

   - Centralized database for enhanced record-keeping.
   - Captures information about customers, including new connections and disconnections.
8. **User Interface:**

   - User-friendly interface for customers and administrators.
   - Home page for general information and navigation.
9. **Technological Stack:**

   - Built using Django for the backend.
   - Utilizes jQuery AJAX for asynchronous communication.
   - Bootstrap 4 for responsive and visually appealing front-end design.

The overall result is a comprehensive system that facilitates electricity metering, billing, and control, providing a user-friendly interface for both consumers and administrators. It aims to improve efficiency in managing electricity consumption, billing processes, and control of load appliances. Additionally, the use of SMS communication and a centralized database enhances communication with service providers and ensures effective record-keeping.
