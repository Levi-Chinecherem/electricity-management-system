1. **Rename the `metering` App Directory:**

   ```bash
   mv metering electricity_management
   ```
2. **Update `INSTALLED_APPS`:**
   In your `settings.py`, update the `INSTALLED_APPS` to replace `'metering'` with `'electricity_management'`:

   ```python
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       # ...
       'home',
       'accounts',
       'admin_panel',
       'electricity_management',
       # ...
   ]
   ```
3. **Update Project URLs:**
   In your main `urls.py`, update the include path for the `'electricity_management'` app:

   ```python
   from django.contrib import admin
   from django.urls import path, include

   urlpatterns = [
       path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
       path('', include('home.urls')),
       path('accounts/', include('accounts.urls')),
       path('admin_panel/', include('admin_panel.urls')),
       path('electricity_management/', include('electricity_management.urls')),
   ]
   ```
4. **Update App Code:**
   Update the code within the `electricity_management` app to reflect the new name. This includes updating folder names, file names, and any references to the old app name. Make sure to update import statements and references in views, models, templates, and URLs.
5. **(Optional) Migrate Database:**
   If your `metering` and `billing` apps had models and you've made changes to them, you may need to create and apply migrations for the new app.

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

Now, you should have a combined `electricity_management` app that encompasses the functionalities of both the `metering` and `billing` apps. Let me know if you have any specific requests or if you'd like assistance with a particular part of the code!
